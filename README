Download GPX data to Garmin GPS devices.

== Description ==

This plugin uses the Garmin Communicator Plugin to allow downloading of GPX data to connected Garmin GPS devices.

== Installation ==

1.  Extract the zip file and drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation.
2.  Activate the plugin from Plugins page.
3.  Go to the plugin settings page and enter your Garmin site key.

You can get a Garmin site key from the [Garmin Developer website](http://developer.garmin.com/web-device/garmin-communicator-plugin/get-your-site-key/)

To add a download link to a post:

1.  Create a custom field called \'gpx\' with GPX data.
2.  Insert the gpx shortcode into your post. Use the \'name\' parameter to specify the filename that is created on the device. This should be unique.
